# A-Coffee-Shop

This is my forst repository on GitHub

The application will begin automatically once running. The program need only require a keyboard to scan in.

I can be reached via the email Lsuarez4703@sdsu.edu.

The MAIN file will be the driving code for the program, holing the methods for that will be the result of input into the code.

The COFFEE file is an interface that is implemented throughout some classes.

BASICCOFFEE, BLACKCOFFEE, MILK, SUGAR, WHIPPEDCREAM, ESPRESSO, and HOTWATER, are all classes extend the COFFEEDECORATOR class in order to construct coffee 
objects in the program.
